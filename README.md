# MapReduceWordCounter
        A service-oriented web application &amp; the SOAP services that          collectively count the number of words in a text file via MapReduce. The user uploads a text file &amp; has the option to input the          URLs of other services to perform the tasks or to use the default services. The web application binds to the          services dynamically. To ensure that the tasks are performed in parallel, multithreading is implemented: each thread receives         a partition of the words in the text file &amp; invokes the web services. The web services are configured such that a new instance          is created per call. It mimics the Hadoop process by distributing the data &amp; the processing over a network.
